## What we do:
### Threat Actors Don't Think In Acronyms
#### Neither Should Your Solutions 

Protecting identities in a modern digital enterprise is complex when they move across authentication boundaries. Permiso creates a single pane of glass for your identities across identity providers, cloud service providers, software as a service apps and infrastructure as code solutions to find the riskiest actors in your environments. We're fueled by finding evil in the cloud. Don't believe us? Check out our research.

Identity-related issues are behind 94% of breaches. Compromised access keys, blind spots, confusing policies, unsafe vendors! Permiso matches up key events to key identities so you see who is doing exactly what with a fast alert in plain English and a plan to respond.
